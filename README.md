## Scottish Government Covid-19 Modelling

### Kalman Filter

A Kalman filter has been used by the Scottish Government to estimate the
R value for Covid-19. This method uses case data to provide a more up to
date R estimate than is provided by the UKHSA consensus and serves as an
additional check of these estimates.

This method has also been used to analyse the change in R value across
Ireland and Denmark, following the lifting of all restrictions in these
countries.

The results from the Kalman filter analysis have been considered
internally by Scottish Government and have not been published.

The [code](https://github.com/crondonm/TrackingR) used to apply this
method was written and developed by Francisco Arroyo, Francisco Bullano,
Simas Kucinskas, and Carlos Rondón-Moreno.

### Other Covid-19 Modelling

This model is one of a
[series](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ac19-modelling+org%3ADataScienceScotland+fork%3Atrue)
used by the Scottish Government during the pandemic to model the spread
and levels of Covid-19 in Scotland. Many of the results of these models
have been published in the [Modelling the
Epidemic](https://www.gov.scot/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-modelling-the-epidemic/)
series of reports.
